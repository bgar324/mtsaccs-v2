This is the official website for the Mt. SAC Computer Science Club, built with Next.js and TailwindCSS. Our website serves as a central hub for club information, events, and resources for our members.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The first version of the CS Club website fulfilled its purpose but lacked structure, scalability, and visual consistency across pages. Version 2 was built to resolve these limitations by adopting a more thoughtful design system, mobile-first responsiveness, and a simplified codebase using modern tooling (Next.js 14, TailwindCSS, Lucide). This iteration focuses on accessibility, cohesive branding, and smoother UX across both static content and dynamic event functionality. It's a foundation not just for aesthetics, but for maintainability and contribution going forward.

## 🚀 Features

- **Modern Design**: Built with a clean, responsive interface using TailwindCSS
- **Dynamic Events**: Showcase of upcoming and past club events with RSVP functionality
- **Team Showcase**: Profiles of our officers, advisors, and team members
- **Project Portfolio**: Gallery of club projects and achievements
- **Easy Navigation**: Intuitive layout with quick access to important information
- **Responsive**: Fully functional across all device sizes
